> In Linux everything is a FILE üìå
>> The Linux structure is as represented and explained but only directories ,files, command, command options, and topics that are significant note are included here as a quick use guide.  üìå

## Directory and File Structure
```
 * üìÅ / -> the Root of all files and directory 
     * üìÅ /boot/ -> This is where the Linux kernel and boot loader files are kept. The kernel is a file called vmlinuz.
     * üìÅ  /etc/ -> System configuration files directory
         * üìÑ /etc/profile -> main default startup file for the bash shell on the system. All users on the system execute this startup file when they log in
         * üìÅ /etc/profile.d/ -> application-specific startup files that is executed by the shell when you log in
         * üìÑ /etc/passwd -> The passwd file contains the essential information for each user. This is where user accounts are defined. a special file to match the login name to a corresponding UID value
         * üìÑ /etc/shadow -> File contains one record for each user account on the system, Only the root user has access
         * üìÑ /etc/group -> file contains information about each group used on the system
         * üìÑ /etc/hosts -> This file lists the network host names and IP addresses that are known to the system.
         * üìÑ /etc/fstab -> Contains a table of devices that get mounted when the system boots. This file defines the system's disk drives
         * üìÅ /etc/init.d/ -> This directory contains the scripts that start various system services at boot time.
     * üìÅ /home/ -> home directory, where Linux creates user directories
     * üìÅ /lib/ -> The shared libraries (similar to DLLs in that other operating system)
     * üìÅ /root/ -> This is the superuser's home directory.
     * üìÅ /tmp/ -> Directory in which runing programs can write their temporary files.
     * üìÅ /dev/ -> Device directory, where Linux creates device nodes for  devices that are available to the system, In Linux (like Unix), devices are treated like files
         * üìÑ /dev/sda -> the first hard drive
         * üìÑ /dev/fd0 -> the first floppy disk drive
     * üìÅ /proc/ -> process directory, where current hardware and process information is stored It is entirely virtual. The directory contains little peep holes into the kernel itself.
         * üìÑ /proc/cpuinfo -> tell you what the kernel thinks of the system's CPU
     * üìÅ /mnt/ -> mount directory, common place for mount points used for removable media
     * üìÅ /media/ -> media directory, a common place for mount points used for removable media
     * üìÅ /opt/ -> optional directory, often used to store third-party software packages and data files
     * üìÅ /run/ -> run directory, where runtime data is held during system operation
     * üìÅ /sys/ -> system directory, where system hardware information files are stored
     * üìÅ /srv/ -> service directory, where local services store their files
     * üìÅ /sbin/ -> super user system binary directory,  contain system programs for system administration (super User only programs)
     * üìÅ /bin/ -> system Binary directory, where many GNU utilities are stored
     * üìÅ /usr/ -> user binary directory, user-level utilities and data files are stored
         * üìÅ /usr/sbin/ -> super user binary directory, contain user programs for system administration (super User only programs)
         * üìÅ /usr/bin/  -> user binary directory, contains applications for the system's users.
         * üìÅ /usr/local/ -> local system directory, contain all user installed programs that is not part of the official distribution
             * üìÅ  /usr/local/bin/ -> local system user binary directory, contains binary files of user installed programs 
         * üìÅ /usr/share/ -> user shared programs
            * üìÅ /usr/share/man/ -> The man pages are kept here.
            * üìÅ /usr/share/dict -> Dictionaries for the spelling checker that comes with Linux
            * üìÅ /usr/share/doc/ -> Various documentation files in a variety of formats.
     * üìÅ /var -> Directory contains files that change as the system is running.
         * üìÅ /var/log/ -> Directory that contains log files. These are updated as the system runs, recording information such as the systems health
         * üìÅ /var/spool/ -> This directory is used to hold files that are queued for some process, such as mail messages and print jobs
            * üìÑ /var/log/spool/mail -> stores mail messages
```

When you log in to the Linux system, the bash shell starts as a login shell. The login shell typically looks for five different startup files to process commands from:
* /etc/profile üìÑ -> main default startup file for the bash shell on the system. All users on the system execute this startup file when they log in

The other four startup files are specific for each user and can be customized for an individual user‚Äôs requirements

*  $HOME/.bash_profile  -> file first checks to see if the startup file, .bashrc, is present in the HOME directory. If it‚Äôs there, the startup file executes the commands in the .bashrc file
*  $HOME/.profile üìÑ -> 
*  $HOME/.bashrc üìÑ -> 
*  $HOME/.bash_login üìÑ -> 



### /etc/passwd üìÑ
shows credentials of both ***system account*** created by linux system for services access to resources and user accounts
**Format** : 
* The login username
* The password for the user
* The numerical UID of the user account
* The numerical group ID (GID) of the user account
* A text description of the user account (called the comment field)
* The location of the HOME directory for the user
* The default shell for the user
