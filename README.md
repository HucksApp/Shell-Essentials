> In Linux everything is a FILE üìå
>> The Linux structure is as represented and explained but only directories ,files, command, command options, and topics that are significant note are included here as a quick use guide.  üìå

## Directory and File Structure
```
 * üìÅ / -> the Root of all files and directory 
     * üìÅ /boot/ -> This is where the Linux kernel and boot loader files are kept. The kernel is a file called vmlinuz.
     * üìÅ  /etc/ -> System configuration files directory
         * üìÑ /etc/profile -> 
         * üìÑ /etc/passwd -> The passwd file contains the essential information for each user. This is where user accounts are defined.
         * üìÑ /etc/shadow ->
         * üìÑ /etc/hosts -> This file lists the network host names and IP addresses that are known to the system.
         * üìÑ /etc/fstab -> Contains a table of devices that get mounted when the system boots. This file defines the system's disk drives
         * üìÅ /etc/init.d/ -> This directory contains the scripts that start various system services at boot time.
     * üìÅ /home/ -> home directory, where Linux creates user directories
     * üìÅ /lib/ -> The shared libraries (similar to DLLs in that other operating system)
     * üìÅ /root/ -> This is the superuser's home directory.
     * üìÅ /tmp/ -> Directory in which runing programs can write their temporary files.
     * üìÅ /dev/ -> Device directory, where Linux creates device nodes for  devices that are available to the system, In Linux (like Unix), devices are treated like files
         * üìÑ /dev/sda -> the first hard drive
         * üìÑ /dev/fd0 -> the first floppy disk drive
     * üìÅ /proc/ -> process directory, where current hardware and process information is stored It is entirely virtual. The directory contains little peep holes into the kernel itself.
         * üìÑ /proc/cpuinfo -> tell you what the kernel thinks of the system's CPU
     * üìÅ /mnt/ -> mount directory, common place for mount points used for removable media
     * üìÅ /media/ -> media directory, a common place for mount points used for removable media
     * üìÅ /opt/ -> optional directory, often used to store third-party software packages and data files
     * üìÅ /run/ -> run directory, where runtime data is held during system operation
     * üìÅ /sys/ -> system directory, where system hardware information files are stored
     * üìÅ /srv/ -> service directory, where local services store their files
     * üìÅ /sbin/ -> super user system binary directory,  contain system programs for system administration (super User only programs)
     * üìÅ /bin/ -> system Binary directory, where many GNU utilities are stored
     * üìÅ /usr/ -> user binary directory, user-level utilities and data files are stored
         * üìÅ /usr/sbin/ -> super user binary directory, contain user programs for system administration (super User only programs)
         * üìÅ /usr/bin/  -> user binary directory, contains applications for the system's users.
         * üìÅ /usr/local/ -> local system directory, contain all user installed programs that is not part of the official distribution
             * üìÅ  /usr/local/bin/ -> local system user binary directory, contains binary files of user installed programs 
         * üìÅ /usr/share/ -> user shared programs
            * üìÅ /usr/share/man/ -> The man pages are kept here.
            * üìÅ /usr/share/dict -> Dictionaries for the spelling checker that comes with Linux
            * üìÅ /usr/share/doc/ -> Various documentation files in a variety of formats.
     * üìÅ /var -> Directory contains files that change as the system is running.
         * üìÅ /var/log/ -> Directory that contains log files. These are updated as the system runs, recording information such as the systems health
         * üìÅ /var/spool/ -> This directory is used to hold files that are queued for some process, such as mail messages and print jobs
            * üìÑ /var/log/spool/mail -> stores mail messages
```
